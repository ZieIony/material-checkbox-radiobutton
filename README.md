# material-checkbox-radiobutton
Animated CheckBox and RadioButton material widgets.

I was asked to extract some of the features of the Carbon library to separate projects so it's possible to include just one feature in one's app. This project is one of them. 

For all features, demos, changelog and Maven support check out Carbon: https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon
